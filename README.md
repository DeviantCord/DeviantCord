# DeviantCord
DeviantCord is a Discord bot that will allow artists and fan communities to keep up to date on their favorite artists on DeviantArt through Discord. 

For example posting links to your comic each time you post a new page is something this bot will replace. It will automatically check the configured artists folders for new entries and will post a new message in a specific Discord channel when a new deviation is found with a link to the deviation. 

# FAQ
#### What is DeviantCord?
DeviantCord is a Discord Bot with the primary function of integrating into DeviantArt. Its biggest feature right now is being able to automatically check certain DA Gallery folders and post a notification in Discord when a new deviation is posted. 

#### What Programming language does the bot use?
DeviantCord 4 currently is developed with Java 17, but should be compatible with Java 11. This may change as we see fit. 

#### Do you have a documentation site?
Yes, you can find it [here](https://deviantcord.com)

#### Can I contribute to the project?
Yes! We are always looking for more people to help develop the bot. If you are interested in joining the development team, please contact Rikey's on the [DeviantCord Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ubmkcsk)

#### I want to request a feature!
Please submit your feature request on the Github Issue Tracker. We are currently not implementing any new features until the current beta is over. 

#### What is the license for DeviantCord?
DeviantCord 4 is licensed under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](https://github.com/DeviantCord/DeviantCord/blob/master/LICENSE)

#### Where do I get support?
You can get support on the [DeviantCord Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ubmkcsk)

#### Where do I find build artifacts/instructions for building the bot myself?
Currently we do not have a guide for building the bot yourself. The process should be as simple as cloning the repository and running './gradlew build' inside the project directory and then running the all-jar that is built inside the build/libs directory.
