## Removals
- Users no longer need to wait for DeviantCord staff to approve the bot on their server!
- Removed the addartist command, as addfolder will now add an artist regardless of whether the artist has a listener on the
guild involved or not. 
- Removed the manualSync command, for stability reasons. 
- Removed the reload command, due to server specific data being stored in a database and being applied instantly. 
- Artdata is no longer used in a JSON file.

right in to your server by using the bot invite link on the Github, Documentation, or our Discord Server. 
- Self Hosted bots for DeviantCord 2 no longer needs to have separate configured bots running in different screen sessions.
DeviantCord2 runs within 1 screen session and is multiserver.
- You are no longer limited to only 1 channel for a specific folder serverwide. You can now have the same folder
posted to multiple channels (Not within the same command, you will need to use the command and specify each channelid
one at a time)

This was implemented for our Production Servers to spot bugs more quickly and only grabs error data from the public bot.

## [bt-1.3.0] - 2019-06-26

## Changes
- DeviantCord now allows for third party cogs written with DiscordPy to used be alongside DeviantCord on self-hosted bots. Though we are not responsible for any cogs you use with DeviantCord.  
- config.json version updated to bt-1.2.5

## [bt-1.2.5] - 2019-06-22
NOTE THIS BUILD: Was not released to the public, it was only used on our public hosting before an incident in the community caused us to have to implement a needed feature thus the creation of bt-1.3.0
### Fixed
- An inconsistency with skiprolecheck not being declared in addfolder that caused a UnBoundLocalError
- Incorrect naming in logs for deviantcog, and the discord debug file
- Issues with a the findFolderUUID method always returning None if the artist does not have more then 10 folders
- An infinite loop that would occur if a gallery with less then 20 deviations uses the getGallery method. This would cause the bot to freeze and stop responding. The SSH session using the bot would also freeze/ctrl + c would not respond. 
- An issue with the error handler not being awaited for

### Changes
- If the getGallery method in daParser interacts with a galleryfolder with less 20 deviations, the bot will recognize it and break out of the while loop to prevent an infinite loop.
- In daParser the getGallery method now uses findDuplicateElementArray instead of findDuplicateElementJson
- The error handler method in daCommands is no longer async.
- The error_handler has been reworked slightly to at least perform basic diagnostics using methods from the upcoming bt-1.4.0 build of DeviantCord.

### Changed
- manualGetToken now runs as a last resort to renew all async tasks
