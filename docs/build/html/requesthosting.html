<h1>Requesting Hosting for DeviantCord<a class="headerlink" href="#requesting-hosting-for-deviantcord" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h1>
<p>Errite/the group that develops the bot allows for communities to request hosting for the bot through us.
Though we do have a few requirements</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Join the DeviantCord Discord server</p></li>
<li><p>Fill out the Google Forms for requesting hosting</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These requirements are mandatory to make sure that staff members can contact server owners by having a mutual server
additionally it will allow for server owners/staff to be able to see announcements regarding the bot such as maintenance,
and issues.</p>
<section id="support">
<h2>Support<a class="headerlink" href="#support" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Support will be given only through the official DeviantCord Discord server.
Our support team at this time is very small and we plan on expanding it, but we keep support to Discord
to allow for others to help out and also allow for others who may be experiencing problems to see solutions staff may
have already answered.</p>

<section id="i-ve-requested-it-now-what">
<h2>I’ve requested it! Now what?<a class="headerlink" href="#i-ve-requested-it-now-what" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Requests will usually be done in no more then 3 days, to which a staff member will DM you with an invite link for
the bot. However since the staff team consists of volunteers there may be times where there are delays. These delays
will usually be talked about in the delays discord text channel. If there is no response to you and nothing in the delays
text channel contact a staff member.</p>

<section id="faq">
<h2>FAQ<a class="headerlink" href="#faq" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p><strong>How are version upgrades handled?</strong></p>
<p>Bug Fixes will be applied to all server being hosted by us upon the updates being posted to Github*
Updates always go through a testing process to make sure everything is functioning properly before a release.*
When a new update is finished and released an announcement will be posted in the maintenance text chat</p>
<p><strong>Who will have access to my bots files?</strong></p>
<p>Only Errite Employee’s and certain staff members will be given access outside of server owners in order to fix issues
and maintain the bot. Those who are given access are required to have a large amount of experience with Errite or with
the team for them to have access to the files.
(The organization who maintains the bot).</p>
<p><strong>Are there any backups for our bots data?</strong></p>
<p>All data is backed up daily on another server. Backups are retained for one month before being deleted.</p>
<p><strong>What is Errite?</strong></p>
<p>Errite is an organization based out of Chicago that primarily specializes in Art, Game Development, and software
development. Most of the individuals behind the creation of the bot are in this organization.</p>
<p><strong>Is there any difference between the self-hosting and the hosting you provide?</strong></p>
<p>No, there is no major difference at this time in terms of functionality. The files provided on Github are the same ones
used on the hosting we provide. The only difference is that we handle the management of the bot from the hosting side of
things such as handling maintenance, and upgrading the bot.</p>
